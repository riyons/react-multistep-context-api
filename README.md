# React Multi-Step Form Using Context API + Hooks
React Multi-Step form boilerplate is a very simple implementation of how to use Context API + Hooks in your real world project. Context API is an amazing feature introduced with React version 16.3.0 that lets you avoid prop-drilling. And React-hooks let you use the React without classes.

In this example, I created a simple multi-step form component with navigation buttons to *__switch the components__* inside the Multi-Step form. 
This is a reusable Multi-Step form component, you can call the Multi-Step form component from anywhere in your React component and dynamically add the components to switch between screens.

# React Reusable Multistep Form Using Context API + Hooks
React Multi-Step form boilerplate is a very simple implementation of how to use *__Context API + Hooks__* in your real world project. Context API is an amazing feature introduced with React version 16.3.0 that lets you avoid prop-drilling. And React-hooks let you use the React without classes.

In this example, I created a simple multi-step form component for a *__product checkout page__* with navigation buttons. The navigation buttons will be used to *__switch between pages__* inside the Multi-Step form. 
This is a reusable Multi-Step form component, you can call the Multi-Step form component from anywhere in your React project and pass your components to the Multi-Step module. We use the React Context API and hooks to share the state between components and update the state from a child component. This is used to prevent unsaved changes from being lost when you navigate from one page to another. You can enable or disable the navigation buttons inside the child components. The Multi-Step form module has a dynamic progress bar that can be turned on or off based on your needs.

#### Features
* React Context API to Manage/Share State and Interaction between components.
* Reusable multistep form component you can call from anywhere in your React project.
* Easy to customize Progress bar.
* Ability to control Navigation buttons from the child components. (In this example, if all the products in the 'Review Order' tab are removed, the 'Next' button will be disabled.)
* Shows how to manage state in functional components with React Hooks.
* Shows how to pass state values to child components using React Context API (Without Prop Drilling).
* Shows how to update the state of the parent component through a React Consumer.
* Reactstrap (React Bootstrap 4 components) for Styling.
* Heroku integration for online demo.

#### Sample code on how to integrate this module into your component
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { ShippingAddress, PaymentDetails, ReviewOrder, OrderConfirmation } from "./components/billing/index"; // Components to switch between screens.
import MultiStepForm from "./components/common/MultiStepForm/MultiStepForm"; // Reusable react multi-form component
import OrderContext from './context/orderContext'; // Context API

// Array object to include the list of components you want to pass into the multi-step form module.
// Please note that the 'headerText' and 'headerIcon' properties within the Array object below are optional. These properties are used to display the title and icon in the progress bar.
const componentsList = [
  { headerText: 'Shipping Address', headerIcon: 'fa fa-address-card', component: <ShippingAddress /> },
  { headerText: 'Payment Details', headerIcon: 'fa fa-credit-card', component: <PaymentDetails /> },
  { headerText: 'Review Order', headerIcon: 'fa fa-clock-o', component: <ReviewOrder /> },
  { headerText: 'Order Confirmation', headerIcon: 'fa fa-check', component: <OrderConfirmation /> },
];

function App() {

  // Initializing state to store the checkout details.
  // This is used to prevent losing unsaved changes when you switch the component.
  const [checkoutDetails, setCheckoutDetails] = useState({});

  return (
    <div className="App">

      <OrderContext.Provider value={{ checkoutDetails, setCheckoutDetails }}>
        <MultiStepForm
          list={componentsList}
          displayProgressBar={true} // Set this to false if you don't want to display the progress bar.
        />
      </OrderContext.Provider>

    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```
